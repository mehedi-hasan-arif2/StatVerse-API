**StatVerse-API** is a self-built analytics engine designed to move beyond generic GitHub stats. I built this from scratch using **Node.js** and **manual SVG logic** to transform raw developer data into stunning visual narratives. [cite: 2026-01-12]



## 💡 Why StatVerse?
Standard GitHub profile cards felt repetitive and lacked personality. I wanted to build a bridge where **Data meets Art**. By swapping heavy libraries for custom SVG coordinate math and CSS keyframes, StatVerse-API delivers high-performance, lightweight, and visually unique dashboards. [cite: 2026-01-12]

## 🚀 What’s Inside the Lab?

### 1. The Analytics Core (Data-to-SVG)
Every card is a product of manual experimentation with SVG paths and GitHub's API architecture: [cite: 2026-01-12]
* **Space Orbit Metrics:** A mathematical representation of developer strength using hexagonal coordinate geometry. [cite: 2026-01-12]
* **Language Proficiency:** Custom "Battery-style" bars with signature charging animations. [cite: 2026-01-12]
* **Evolution Ranking:** A logic-driven grading system analyzing contribution density. [cite: 2026-01-12]
* **Dynamic Particles:** Floating UI elements and twinkling star-fields rendered through pure CSS. [cite: 2026-01-12]

### 2. The Simulation Zone (Interactive HTML5)
New for 2026, I’ve integrated a **Cyber-Drifter Mission Engine**. This isn't just a game; it's a visual stress test for the StatVerse environment, built with Canvas API and CSS-VFX. [cite: 2026-01-13]
