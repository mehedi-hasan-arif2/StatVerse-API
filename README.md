# 🌌 StatVerse-API (Creative GitHub Metrics Lab)

Welcome to **StatVerse-API**! This is a personal project I built to turn boring GitHub statistics into stunning visual experiences. Instead of just numbers, I believe in showing impact through creativity.

### 🚀 What's Inside?
- **Space Orbit Card:** A dynamic SVG visualization of GitHub stats with an orbital animation.
- **Future Ready:** I am currently building more interactive features like:
  - **Language Radar Cards:** Deep dive into coding habits.
  - **Contribution Snake Game:** Transforming the contribution graph into a playable/animated game.
  - **3D Contribution Graphs:** Visualizing work history in a three-dimensional space.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Data:** GitHub REST API
- **Visuals:** SVG, CSS Animations
- **Deployment:** Vercel

### 🛠️ Purpose
I created this to provide developers with unique ways to showcase their profiles. Everything here is custom-coded, focusing on performance, security (using Environment Variables), and modern design.
